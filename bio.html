            I've always been interested in science and math. In middle school, I did mathematics and computational linguistics olympiads. I had some decent success, but my interest pivoted to robotics in high school.

            I joined my school's VEX robotics team in my freshman year of high school where I learned the fundamentals of robot mechanics, control, and design. Frankly, I was pretty terrible at it, but I was fortunate to be mentored by <a href="https://zietek.dev">Jacob Zietek</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lily-coffin-35528b189/">Lily Coffin</a>, who were seniors at the time. Here's some of the stuff I did in my time doing VEX:
            <ul>
                <li>Competed at Worlds (twice!)</li>
                <li>Won a few regional competitions</li>
                <li>Peaked 1st in NY and 30th in the world at some point</li>
                <li>Co-created the <a href="https://github.com/vindou/VEX-CAD-Fusion-360-Library">VEX CAD Fusion 360 Library 2.0</a> with <a href="https://gilcha.com">Gilbert Chang</a></li>
                <li>Used classical computer vision techniques to automate disc throwing</li>
                <li>Messed with control algorithms for faster autonomous routines</li>
                <li>Led an awesome team for 3 years and designed+built+programmed several robots end-to-end</li>
                <li>Founded CTOW, an alliance of elite teams across the world with 300+ awards to date including several state champion, national champion, Worlds division & overall champion titles</li>
                <li>Met some amazing friends :)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            I did a lot of Taekwondo before my undergrad as well (12 years of it :o). I'm a third degree black belt, and I taught classes for 5 years. I credit Taekwondo for a lot of the way I live my life and my work ethic. I learned a lot about discipline, hard work, and perseverance through it. I really encourage anyone who's curious to give it a shot!
