            My mom asked me to make this for her friend who has a son in high school. At the time of writing this, he's a sophomore, and an avid swimmer and knitter. He gets good grades, but isn't really sure of what to do with his future. I gave this a lot of thought, and I think it might be useful for others too, so here it is!

            I'm not sure if I'm particularly qualified to write this, but I've been confused on what to do with my life in the past, so I figured I could share my thoughts and the advice that helped me. You've probably heard this before, but I think it's important to remember that it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. You don't need to know exactly what you want to do (I certainly don't!). Hopefully the following gives you some clarity and helps you figure out what you want to do.

            Do what you like

            This is a little clich√©, but it's important. If you don't like what you're doing, you're not going to be happy. Just saying, "do what you like" is a little dismissive, though. It can be really difficult to discern what you like and don't like, especially in high school. If you don't have a strong conviction in either direction about something, it can take quite a while to figure out how you feel about it. Additionally, there's just so many things we could possibly do, it's impractical to explore everything. We need a way to narrow down our search space without spending too much time on it.
