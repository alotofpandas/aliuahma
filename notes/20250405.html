            My mom asked me to make this for her friend who has a son in high school. At the time of writing this, he's a sophomore, and an avid swimmer and knitter. He gets good grades, but isn't really sure of what to do with his future. I gave this a lot of thought, and I think it might be useful for others too, so here it is!

            I'm not sure if I'm particularly qualified to write this, but I've been confused on what to do with my life in the past, so I figured I could share my thoughts and the advice that helped me. You've probably heard this before, but I think it's important to remember that it's okay to not have everything figured out right now. You don't need to know exactly what you want to do (I certainly don't!). Hopefully the following gives you some clarity and helps you figure out what you want to do.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Do what you like
        </h2>

        <p>
            This is a little clich√©, but it's important. Just saying, "do what you like" is a little dismissive, though. I understand that it's difficult to discern what you like and don't like, especially in high school. I took a really wide range of classes in high school, so while I didn't really delve deep into a lot of things, I was able to figure out pretty quickly what I didn't like. I actually wanted to be a doctor for a while, 

            It can be really difficult to discern what you like and don't like, especially in high school. If you don't have a strong conviction in either direction about something, it can take quite a while to figure out how you feel about it. Additionally, there's just so many things we could possibly do, it's impractical to explore everything. There are a few ways to narrow down your search space, though.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Do it well
        </h2>

        <p>
            
        </p>

        <h2>
            Success is non-linear
        </h2>

        <p>
            A friend of mine's dad once told me something that really stuck: "Success is measured by the options you have." I'm not going to make much comment on this, because I think the way that you interpret this is unique to you, and will help you make decisions on what you want to do. Having options available to you gives you the power of choice. Do things that give you options.
